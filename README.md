# ShoeCollectionV2
 Upgraded Shoe Collection program written in C++
 
 A personal project I undertook that was inspired for my passion for shoes and my collection.
 The program keeps track of the users collection by holding the collection in a list and being able to save the collection via text tile
 
 # Improvements from V1:
  * Made a class for shoe instead of holding the properties with three different arrays
  * Used vectors to hold the list as opposed to dynamic array to make importing, adding, and removing easier
  * More functionality since vectors are a lot easier to work with
  
 # What I learned on this project
  * Learned how to work with vectors and be comfortable using the functionalities that they provide
  * Got more experience using a class as I was a bit confused with them before
  * Overall understand Object Oriented Programming a lot better now as I got to practice with it
